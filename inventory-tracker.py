Self-destructive behavior is any behavior that is harmful or
potentially harmful towards the person who engages in the behavior.

Self-destructive behaviors exist on a continuum, with suicide at one
extreme end of the scale.[1] Self-destructive actions may be
deliberate, born of impulse, or developed as a habit. The term however
tends to be applied toward self-destruction that either is fatal, or
is potentially habit-forming or addictive and thus potentially
fatal. Self-destructive behavior is often associated with mental
illnesses such as borderline personality disorder[2] or
schizophrenia.[3][4]

Acts of "self-destruction" may be merely metaphorical ("social
suicide") or literal (suicide).

Types of self-destructive behavior
* Suicide
* Self-harm
* Eating disorders [medical citation needed]
* Substance abuse

Self-destructive behavior may be used as a coping mechanism when one
is overwhelmed. For example, faced with a pressing scholastic
assessment, someone may choose to sabotage their work rather than cope
with the stress. This would make submission of (or passing) the
assessment impossible, but remove the worry associated with it.

Self-destructive behavior may also manifest itself in an active
attempt to drive away other people. For example, they may fear that
they will "mess up" a relationship. Rather than deal with this fear,
socially self-destructive individuals engage in annoying or alienating
behavior, so that others will reject them first.

More obvious forms of self-destruction are eating disorders, alcohol
abuse, drug addictions, sex addiction, self-injury, and suicide
attempts.

An important aspect of self-destructive behavior is the inability to
handle the stress stemming from an individual's lack of
self-confidence â€“ for example in a relationship, whether the other
person is truly faithful ("how can they love someone like me?"); at
work or school, whether the realization of assignments and deadlines
is possible ("there is no way I can complete all my work on
time"). Self-destructive people usually lack healthier coping
mechanisms, like asserting personal boundaries. As a result, they tend
to feel that showing they are incompetent is the only way to untangle
themselves from demands.

Successful individuals may self-destructively sabotage their own
achievements; this may stem from a feeling of anxiety, unworthiness,
or from an impulsive desire to repeat the "climb to the top."

Self-destructive behavior is often considered to be synonymous with
self-harm, but this is not accurate. Self-harm is an extreme form of
self-destructive behavior, but it may appear in many other guises.'''
